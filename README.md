Development phase:

1. Repurposed simple motor from children's toy car to act as a weak generator.
2. Attached a screwdriver to drive the motor and spin it.
3. Connected terminals of the motor to a voltmeter to measure voltage and current generated.
4. Used simple USB converter for connection between generator and AAA charging case.
5. Currently working on developing a method of measuring SOC.
  - To assess energy storage capacity for wind turbine
